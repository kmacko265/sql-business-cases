Business question
How long does it take to fulfill orders?
Is order processing consistent, or are there delays in the system?

SELECT
  DATE(orders.created_at) AS order_date,
  COUNT(DISTINCT orders.order_id) AS number_of_orders,
  ROUND(AVG
    (TIMESTAMP_DIFF
      (orders.shipped_at,orders.created_at,DAY)),2) AS avg_fulfillment_days
FROM `practice-yooo.portfolio_practice.orders` AS orders
WHERE orders.shipped_at IS NOT NULL
GROUP BY order_date
ORDER BY order_date;

Insights

The average fulfillment time shows how efficiently orders are processed from creation to shipment.
Periods with increased fulfillment duration may indicate operational bottlenecks or capacity constraints.
Monitoring fulfillment trends over time helps identify process inefficiencies and supports improvements in logistics and customer experience.
