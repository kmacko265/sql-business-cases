## Case 1 – Country performance

**Business question:** 
"Which countries are most valuable for the company and why?"
"Which markets are the most valuable and where should marketing focus?"

**Dataset:** 
thelook_ecommerce (BigQuery public dataset)

**SQL**

SELECT
  users.country,
  ROUND(SUM(items.sale_price), 2) AS revenue,
  COUNT(DISTINCT orders.order_id) AS number_of_orders,
  COUNT(DISTINCT orders.user_id) AS number_of_users,
  ROUND(SUM(items.sale_price) / COUNT(DISTINCT orders.order_id),2) AS AOV
FROM `practice-yooo.portfolio_practice.orders` AS orders
JOIN `practice-yooo.portfolio_practice.order_items` AS items
  ON orders.order_id = items.order_id
JOIN `practice-yooo.portfolio_practice.users` AS users
  ON users.id = orders.user_id
GROUP BY users.country
ORDER BY revenue DESC;

**Insights**
China generates the highest revenue and outperforms the United States by nearly USD 1.2 million, making it a key market for future decision-making. 
At the same time, China has approximately 14,000 more orders than the U.S., with an average order value of USD 85.97, which indicates strong growth potential. 
While China should be the primary focus of future campaigns, the United States and Brazil remain strategically important markets for performance optimization and revenue stabilization.
